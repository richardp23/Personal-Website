                            From a very young age, I have always been interested in Computer Science. When I was 2 years old, I learned how to use a computer. I was 6, I learned how to build and take apart computers. Fast forward 10 years later, and my love for computers has never been stronger.

                            As of now, I&apos;ve dabbled a bit in the field of website-making. <a href="https://scholarsnyc.com" className="has-text-link">I was even a part of my school&apos;s efforts to create a brand new modern website!</a>

                            In the future, I plan on becoming a full-time software developer. I&apos;m an intermediate coder in terms of web development, and I am now looking to develop my proficiency with JavaScript, TypeScript, and React technologies.
